Introduction
============

red-fab-deploy is a collection of Fabric scripts for deploying and managing projects created with red-start. License is MIT.

This project is specifically targeted at deploying websites built using the red-start project creation tool. Basically this means you must be using git and follow the same folder and file layout as found in that tool.

These tools are being geared towards deploying on Joyent but can be extended to be used on other providers.
